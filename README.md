GalaEngine is a C++17 game engine for 2D games, built with the [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library.

## PLEASE NOTE
GalaEngine is in a very early development stage. Expect bugs and lack of documentation and cross-platform support. If you run into a bug, please report it in the issues section of the GitHub repository.

## Compiling
### Linux
Before compiling on linux, make sure you have the clang compiler, with C++17 supported. GalaEngine should compile with g++, however it has not been tested.
To compile, simply execute the ``build_demo_linux64.sh`` file. Please note that ``build_engine_linux64.sh`` will produce a standalone library in the future, however this is not supported at the moment.

### Windows
GalaEngine does not have an official Windows build script yet, but feel free to check out the linux build scripts to create your own build.

## Using
No documentation exists for GalaEngine, however there are examples available (in the "Demo" folder).
